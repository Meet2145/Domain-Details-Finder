This Python script enables you to perform a WHOIS lookup for any specified domain using socket programming. The script establishes a connection to the WHOIS server (whois.iana.org), sends the domain name for which you want to retrieve information, and then receives and displays the corresponding WHOIS data.

To use the script:

Run the script in your Python environment.
When prompted, enter the domain name you want to look up (e.g., example.com).
The script will connect to the WHOIS server, send the domain name, and retrieve the WHOIS information.
The retrieved WHOIS data, which includes details such as the domain's registry information, will be displayed on the screen.

This tool is useful for gathering domain registration information quickly and programmatically without relying on third-party services.
